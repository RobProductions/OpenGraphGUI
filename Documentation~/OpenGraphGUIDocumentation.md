# Overview

## OpenGraphGUI

An open source custom Shader GUI for Unity. 

## Usage

Most up to date info can be found in the README.md file. 

## Installation

1. Open the Package Manager in Unity
2. Click the '+' icon and hit *"Add package from git URL"*
3. Add the GitHub URL of OpenGraphGUI: [https://github.com/RobProductions/OpenGraphGUI](https://github.com/RobProductions/OpenGraphGUI)
4. Wait for download to complete
5. Add the custom GUI class *RPOpenGraphGUI* to the *Custom Editor GUI* field in your ShaderGraph of choice

If installation fails due to version requirements, you may be able force OpenGraphGUI to work by downloading the project as .zip and editing the "package.json" file to lower the Unity requirement. Deleting the .meta files may also be necessary and shouldn't break anything... I think. Then use the *"Add package from disk"* option to add your custom version instead. 

If you're looking to add a specific release of OpenGraphGUI, you can specify a release tag with the hashtag like so: "https://github.com/RobProductions/OpenGraphGUI#ReleaseNumber"
